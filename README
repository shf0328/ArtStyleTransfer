1. Open the jupyter notebook, open the "ArtTransfer_1st.ipynb"

2. Execute the commands in the second cell first, otherwise plots will NOT be shown
   %matplotlib inline


3. the run() is a wrap function to build the model and generate new images using scipy optimization.
   the runSGD() is the same except that it uses SGD optimization.

4. To provide customized parameters, use 
 run(cl_weight=0.1,con_layers=['conv1_1'], sty_layers=['conv1_1','conv2_1','conv3_1','conv4_1','conv5_1'],
        photopath='./data/Tuebingen_Neckarfront.jpg', 
        artpath='./data/1920px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg')

where cl_weight is the weight of the content loss function, con_layers is the layer you want to use as content 
representation,sty_layers is the layer you want to use as style representation
photopath is the path of the photograph
artpath is the path of the artwork

The weight of the style loss function is default to 2e-6. User can customize the ratio of the
weights between the content and the style by providing the cl_weight with different values.

The photograph files and artwork files must be in the "./data/" subdirectory.

Thank you TAs and Professor!
